    """
    Plots an `nstd` sigma error ellipse based on the specified covariance
    matrix (`cov`). Additional keyword arguments are passed on to the 
    ellipse patch artist.
    Parameters
    ----------
        cov : The 2x2 covariance matrix to base the ellipse on
        pos : The location of the center of the ellipse. Expects a 2-element
            sequence of [x0, y0].
        nstd : The radius of the ellipse in numbers of standard deviations.
            Defaults to 2 standard deviations.
        ax : The axis that the ellipse will be plotted on. Defaults to the 
            current axis.
        Additional keyword arguments are pass on to the ellipse patch.
    Returns
    -------
        A matplotlib ellipse artist
