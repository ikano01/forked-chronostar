Explore the effect of missing radial velocities on the component fits.
Perform two component fits: one where all stars have known radial velocities and one where a fraction of stars have unknown radial velocities (radial_velocity=0, radial_velocity_error=1e+5).
Compare results to see the effect of radial velocity.
