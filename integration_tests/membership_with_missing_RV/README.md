Compute component overlaps for two cases: One where stars have known radial velocities, and one where all stars have assigned radial velocities 0 and their errors are 1e+5.
Compare membership probabilities to see if we can still retrieve RV-less members, and whether there are any false positives. What is the false negative ratio?
