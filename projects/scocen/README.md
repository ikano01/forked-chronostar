## Data
# Results from December 2020
Currently in `Google drive` but will move this to `mash` after some re-organisation:
- `final_comps.fits`: Components
- `members_from_5k_fit_and_overlaps.fits`: Input data and membership probabilities

# Selection function

## Code
- `component_overlaps.py`: Take components and compute star-component overlaps for a big sample of stars.
- `cmd_components_simple.py`: Plot CMDs for all the components
- `galaxy_components_simple.py`: Plot components in `(l, b)` space
- `pds70.py`: Find what component PDS70 belongs to and its component age
- `master_table.py`: Combine data into one big table (e.g. memberships, photometry, astrometry, lithium etc.)
- `fig_settings.py`: Library for pretty plots
